Hello...

Welcome...

You are looking at our submission for Project 1 of ESE 545 (Data Mining: Learning from Massive Datasets).

To run our code, open the proj1_main.py file in your favorite editor,
and change the filepath in line 15 to your locally saved location of
amazonReviews.json.

Check to make sure that proj1_main.py and proj1_functions.py are in
the same location on your local machine.

Our main file is the most of our code with helper functions in the functions file.

Run the code!

If you would like to find the nearest neighbor for Problem 6 of a different
reviewID, uncomment and change line 143 of proj1_main.py to include the reviewID you
would like to use.
